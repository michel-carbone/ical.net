## Release notes

A listing of what each [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ical.Net) version represents.

### v2

* 2.2.30: `Event.Resources` is an `IList` again. Event.Resources wasn't being deserialized, so I have reverted back to an IList to fix this. Sorry everyone. I'm intentionally violating my own semver rules. In the future, I'll call version n+1 "vNext" so I can more freely rev the major version number.
* 2.2.29: Calling `GetOccurrences()` on a recurrable component should recompute the recurrence set. Specifying `EXDATE` values that don't have a `TimeOfDay` component should "black out" that day from a recurring component's `StartTime`.[#223](https://github.com/rianjs/ical.net/issues/223)
* 2.2.25: Fix for Collection was modified exception, and better handling of recurrence ids when calling `Calendar.GetOccurrences` ([#188](https://github.com/rianjs/ical.net/issues/188)) ([#148](https://github.com/rianjs/ical.net/issues/148))
* 2.2.24: Performance enhancement for solidus-prefixed time zones ([#204](https://github.com/rianjs/ical.net/issues/204)).
* 2.2.23: Bugfix for culture for geographic location serialization. RFC-5545 requires coordinates to use decimal points, not commas, regardless of culture. Correct: `1.2345`. Incorrect: `1,2345`. ([#202](https://github.com/rianjs/ical.net/issues/202))
* 2.2.22: Bugfix for `Event` serialization that always changed the `Duration` to 0. Serialization shouldn't have side effects. ([#199](https://github.com/rianjs/ical.net/issues/199))

Changes weren't systematically tracked before 2.2.22.
